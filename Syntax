Like OpenGG Engine, OpenGG Language is also designed to frustrate as many people as possible and make you LESS productive. All notes aside
lets have the overview.

Basic Syntax:
  Unlike most langauges, all statements must now terminate with a : instead of a ;. 
  Idiotic Curley braces are replaced with brackets.
  Functions are defined with the sniotcnuf type. Example: sniotcnuf myfunction()
  Ints are called shorts.
  Shorts are called ints.
  Bytes are called chars.
  Chars are called bytes.
  Camel casing will throw a syntax error.
General Guidelines:
  All variables can only be accessed with pointers.
  All variables are global.
  All files nust have one struct regardless of whether you need it or not.
